Our project was an exciting journey into the world of Roguelike video games, a genre dating back to the 70s, deeply inspired by tabletop RPGs. The challenge was to create a Roguelike game, adhering to the genre's classic elements while ensuring an engaging and fun experience.

Key Features of Roguelike Games:

Tile-Based Gameplay: The game world is constructed from tiles, making it visually distinct and strategically complex.
Turn-Based Mechanics: Players and CPU-controlled entities (monsters, allies) alternate turns, adding a layer of strategic planning to every move.
Exploration and Treasure Hunting: The primary objective typically involves navigating a labyrinth to retrieve treasures.
Permadeath Concept: The stakes are high with the permadeath feature; a single defeat means starting over from scratch.

Project Goals and Learning Outcomes:

Enhanced OOP Practice: The project provided an extensive practice ground for Object-Oriented Programming, crucial for implementing complex game mechanics.
Understanding Design Patterns: We focused on layer separation, ensuring that all game logic (player movement, game rules) was in a separate logic package, independent of the user interface. This approach allows for the potential adaptation of different interfaces (terminal, web, VR) using the same logic code.
Project Implementation:
Our team worked collaboratively to bring this Roguelike game to life, balancing adherence to traditional elements with creative freedom to deviate for enhanced fun. The project served as a platform to deepen our understanding of OOP principles and design patterns, particularly in the context of game development.

Summary:
This Roguelike game project not only allowed us to pay homage to a classic genre but also pushed us to innovate within its boundaries. It was a testament to our team's ability to work together effectively, solve complex problems, and create an enjoyable gaming experience.
